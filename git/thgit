Python Strings-Whitespace I practice    
Center s with blank padding of width # 'hi' => ' hi '
    s.center(width)

Right justify s with total size of width # 'hello' => ' hello'
    s.rjust(width)

Left justify s with total size of width
    s.ljust(width)

Return true if s only contains whitespace characters
    s.isspace()

Slice of s from i to j with step k
    s[i;j;k]

Return highest index of s2 in 2(raise ValueError if not found)
    s.rindex(s2)

Index of first occurrence of s2 in s after index i and before index j
    s.index(s2,i,j)

Return highest index of s2 in s
    s.frind(s2)
